# Sellswords
A Quest Mod for Baldur's Gate II (BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET)!

The Sellswords MOD is an add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II. It is named after a trilogy of fantasy novels, The Sellswords, written by R. A. Salvatore about the infamous assassin, Artemis Entreri, and the cunning drow mercenary, Jarlaxle.

The mod allows the player to meet Kimmuriel Oblodra, the current leader of Bregan D'aerthe, and travel with him to Menzoberranzan to confront a powerful MatronMother, rescue Jarlaxle, and receive some unexpected help from Artemis Entreri.

The mod begins in Chapter 6 as soon as you enter Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla. Throne of Bhaal expansion pack is required.
