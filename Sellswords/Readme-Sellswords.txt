1. Introduction
----------------

The Sellswords MOD is an add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II. It is named after
a trilogy of fantasy novels, The Sellswords, written by R. A. Salvatore about 
the infamous assassin, Artemis Entreri, and the cunning drow mercenary, Jarlaxle.

The mod allows the player to meet Kimmuriel Oblodra, the current leader of Bregan
D'aerthe, and travel with him to Menzoberranzan to confront a powerful Matron
Mother, rescue Jarlaxle, and receive some unexpected help from Artemis Entreri.

The mod begins in Chapter 6 as soon as you enter Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla.
Throne of Bhaal expansion pack is required.

Then backup dialog.tlk, chitin.key, baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override
directory BEFORE installing any mods.

This way, you can restore your "clean install" by deleting weidu.log and
override directory, and restoring all backups.

Baldur's Gate II directory.


Mac OS X:

and follow the instructions on screen.

In case of difficulties:

1. Open the Terminal, type 'chmod +x' followed by a space, drag

3. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: Do I need the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack?
A: Yes, Throne of Bhaal is required.

Q: When and where does the mod begin?
A: Athkatla, Waukeen's Promenade, Chapter 6. A boy will approach you with a note.
Q: But he is not there!
A: Make sure that you have actually installed the mod. Open your game directory
and run Setup-Sellswords.exe. If this file is not there, repeat the installation
process as described above.

Q: CHARNAME in Menzoberranzan? A non-drow? We'll get eaten alive!
A: Maybe... but not right away. A child of god who might or might not have
devastated Ust Natha is a powerful ally, and this Matron Mother might be a tiny
bit unconventional.

Q: Are there new areas?
A: There are three completely new areas: Menzoberranzan/House Jeven, 
Matron Mother's palace and the treasury. There are nine areas in total. Artwork
is by Lava Del'Vortel, whose Colours of Infinity are highly recommended.

Q: How many quests are there?
A: The major quest, which includes several subquests, four additional small
quests and four mini-quests.

Q: Voicing?
A: Absolutely, for major characters and several minor ones. And the actors
did give their best.

Q: Portraits?
A: Several, for the main characters. Take a look at the artists' galleries
in the credits section - they are really worth it.

Q: Will we see Artemis Entreri?
A: Yes. Several times, in fact.

Q: What about Jarlaxle?
A: Naturally, but at the very end of the quest... if you do everything right.

Q: Kimmuriel?
A: Ooooh, lots. Can't say you'll be happy about it, though.

Q: Romance? Friendship? Bromance? Sex? More sex?
A: "Lack of dislike" would be a more proper word combination. :) 
As for character expansion, explore Kimmuriel's main dialogue tree. Also, as 
the honored guest of the Matron Mother, you can always visit the lust chambers.

Q: How mature is this mod?
A: Teen content only. Lust chambers visits do not contain explicit scenes.
At one point a drow wants to assault the female player, but there's an option
to shut him up.

Q: How difficult is this mod?
A: Chapter 6-ish difficult, but easier then the Watcher's Keep.

Q: Any big rewards?
A: There is a special scimitar at the very end of the quest, but it's not
much better than Spectral Brand +4. Two or three vanilla&new game items, too.

Q: Does it have NPC interjections? Crossmod content for mod NPCs?
A: There are numerous interjections for all 15 Bioware NPCs. If you're a modder,
please, feel free to add crossmod content for your characters.
 
Q: Is The Sellswords mod compatible with mod X? 
A: It should work fine with other mods.

Q: When should I install it?
A: Together with Dungeon Crawl or Assassinations or other small quest mods
is fine.

Q: I am in the middle of my game, can I install it over and continue playing?
A: Yes, you can. Make sure the game is not running as you install it, though.

Q: Does it mess up my worldmap?
A: No, it doesn't. You travel to Menzoberranzan via a teleportation spell,
and the mod doesn't touch the worldmap.

Q: I have a problem with one of the quests.
A: Check your journal, map notes and the walkthrough section of the Readme.

Q: What if I kill the wrong person? How shall I come back to Athkatla?
A: Kimmuriel can transport you, or the game will if you attack major characters.

4. Walkthrough (SPOILERS!)
---------------------------

MAIN QUEST
----------

1) Go to Athkatla in Chapter 6. As soon as you enter the Promenade, 
a boy messenger appears and hands you a note.

2) Go to Enge's shop and talk to the drow messenger. Allow him to 
teleport you to the sewers under the Temple District or go there yourself.

3) Talk to Kimmuriel, defeat the trolls, wait for Kimmuriel to appear again.
You will be taken to Menzoberranzan.

You arrive to House Jeven's cavern with Kimmuriel and talk to the Matron Mother.

Her captain awaits outside the tavern. Kimmuriel also will have tasks for you.

The main quest will proceed after you complete two tasks for the captain
and two tasks for Kimmuriel.

You HAVE to talk to Kimmuriel and tell him that you've done both.

You can also abandon the quest: talk to Kimmuriel and return to Athkatla.

4) The captain's first task: find the cheater at the fighers' competition.
Go to the largest platform to the east. The cheater is actually K'Hui.
Talk to Vintul, then to the mage, Mas'Sai, then to Vintul again.
You can also make K'Hui confess if your INT, WIS or CHA is 18 or higher.

5) The captain's second task: kill five spies from the rival house. All
five wear red clothing. It is recommended to talk to Kimmuriel
first and spare a man from Bregan D'aerthe, Nelros.

6) After a talk with the captain, Artemis Entereri appears. 

It is time to tell the news to Kimmuriel.

7) Kimmuriel's first task: kill the githyanki at the uppermost left
platform. It is recommended to talk to them first.

8) Kimmuriel's second task: secure an alliance with the illithids. They
are in the southern(lowest) platform. Afterwards you'll have to go and kill
three brain golems near the platform where the githyanki were. Use blunt weapons.

Talk to Kimmuriel and tell him about your progress. 

9) After you've done all the quests for Kimmuriel and told him about Entreri's
appearance, the Matron Mother shows again and accuses you two of treachery. 

10) Now you must kill her rebel son, Lorn. Find him at the largest platform.
Do not attack him outright: talk to him.

11) Meet Artemis Entreri near the first barrier. He will tell you to kill
Jey'Re Jeven, the Matron Mother's trusted advisor, and take the first wardstone
from him. 

ATTENTION: You will no longer be able to rest in the lust chambers after meeting
Entreri, and resting in the tavern will become unavailable after meeting Jey'Re.

12) Jey'Re Jeven can be found in the lust chambers, next to the tavern.

At this point, you will have all three wardstones to enter the Matron's palace.

13) You will also note that rival forces are attacking House Jeven. 
Fight your way through them and the githyanki ambush and enter the palace.

14) Fight through the Elder Orbs and Matron Mother's guards. Kill the 
Matron Mother, pick the final wardstone off her body and talk to Artemis Entreri.

15) Finally, enter the treasury, where the quest's finale will take place.

Do not to leave for Athkatla before looting the chests!

SUBQUESTS
---------

Lavaes's quest: you need to have a 15++ stat to sell your soul to the demon.
Any stat will do. Use potions to improve your character's statistics.

The Black Arena: you need to have some non-magical weapons for the third
challenge. You can find some in the area.

House of Shades: kill the shades and return to Koba. He will betray you.

Brown drow: you can either let Eilistraee's supporters go or kill them to
get the star sapphires from the priestess.

MINI-QUESTS
-----------

A Stolen Spellbook: you will find it in Lavaes's house.

A Blind Warrior: you will find the cure in the Black Arena.

Jarlaxle's Baby: Kimmuriel won't help you, so you have to give the girl
a thousand gold right away if you want to aid her.

A Slave Girl: this is a trap. You'll have to kill your attackers, who can
be found in the upper left part of the map.
